It is important to accommodate the hybrid networking requirements for Windows Kubernetes nodes.
Azure specific tasks and gotchas are highlighted in this part 1 of 3 while laying the groundwork applicable to deploying OpenShift on any provider in preparation for managing Windows containers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How do OpenShift Over The Air Updates Work?</title><link>http://guifreelife.com/blog/2021/03/09/Understanding-OpenShift-Over-The-Air-Updates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://guifreelife.com/blog/2021/03/09/Understanding-OpenShift-Over-The-Air-Updates/</guid><description>OpenShift 4 extends the operator pattern introduced by CoreOS, and enables automated management of the Kubernetes cluster and the underlying resources including machine instances and operating system configuration. Operator driven over the air updates enable automated updates much like you are accustomed to receiving for your smart phone. What follows is a a technical exploration of the OpenShift over the air updates implementation.
Operators All the Way Down
What is an &amp;ldquo;Operator&amp;rdquo;?</description></item><item><title>OpenShift 4 on OpenStack Networking and Installation</title><link>http://guifreelife.com/blog/2020/02/15/OpenShift-4-on-OpenStack-Networking-and-Installation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://guifreelife.com/blog/2020/02/15/OpenShift-4-on-OpenStack-Networking-and-Installation/</guid><description>OpenShift Containter Platform 4 is much more like Tectonic than OpenShift 3. Particularly when it comes to installation and node management. Rather then building machines and running an Ansible playbook to configure them you now have the option of setting a fewer paramters in an install config running an installer to build and configure the cluster from scratch.
I would like to illustrate how the basics of the networking might look when installing OpenShift on OpenStack.</description></item></channel></rss>
