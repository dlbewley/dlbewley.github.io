To solve this, I added a 2nd router deployment and used the OpenShift router sharding feature to selectively enable routes on the 2nd router by way of selectors.
To summarize:
Existing HA router:
HTTP 80 HTTPS 443 Haproxy Stats 1,936 Added HA router:
HTTP 49,999 HTTPS 50,000 Haproxy Stats 51,936 How To Open infra node firewalls Open firewall on infra nodes where router will run to allow new http and https port iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 49999 -j ACCEPT iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 50000 -j ACCEPT This can also be done with Ansible and the os_firewall role in your playbook.</description></item></channel></rss>
