Recent versions of openshift-install will place all the CA certificates in the generated &lt;code>auth/kubeconfig&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>

Perhaps you want to fix that without mucking with the internal SSL communication? I did. Here is how.
This OpenShift doc explains how to do this, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t very clear, to me at least.
