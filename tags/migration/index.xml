Assumptions:
You are running OCP 3.9 You have multiple Master nodes You have dedicated Etcd nodes You are running RHEL, not Atomic nodes Outline:
Backup etcd Scale up Etcd cluster to include Master nodes Configure Openshift Masters to ignore the old Etcd nodes Scale down etcd cluster to remove old Etcd nodes Detailed Steps Follow along in this document https://docs.</description></item></channel></rss>
